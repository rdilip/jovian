# Jovian: Bidirectional Autoregressive Protein Backbone Generation

**Jovian** is a bidirectional autoregressive model for **protein backbone generation** that  
1. Learns both **sequence length** and **motif positioning** by conditioning on prediction direction.  
2. Enables **simple, zero-shot motif scaffolding** without motif-specific training.  
3. Achieves **10â€“40Ã— faster** inference than comparable models, while matching or exceeding diffusion-based methods on standard benchmarks.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Variable-length generation** â€” no fixed size needed at inference time.
- **Zero-shot conditional design** â€” perform motif scaffolding without retraining.
- **Speed** â€” 10â€“40Ã— faster than diffusion models in unconditional design.
- **Long-sequence stability** â€” maintains robustness for large proteins.
- **Competitive accuracy** â€” matches or surpasses diffusion-based methods on standard benchmarks.
